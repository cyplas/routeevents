This Android application shows current traffic events in Slovenia on a
map. Users input start and end places in Slovenia and the app uses
Google Directions, Google Maps and a traffic web service to show the
user events along their specified routes in either map or list
format. 

Install with Gradle, by typing "gradle build" from the command
line. Then the (debug version of the) Android app is generated in
build/apk/routeevents-debug-unaligned.apk.
